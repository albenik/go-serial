# go-serial

A cross-platform serial library for go-lang based on [github.com/bugst/go-serial](https://github.com/bugst/go-serial) with own import path and some modifications (possible incompatible with original library).

Most ideas taken from [github.com/bugst/go-serial](https://github.com/bugst/go-serial) and [github.com/pyserial/pyserial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial).

Sometime I do backports from [github.com/bugst/go-serial](https://github.com/bugst/go-serial).

Any PR-s are welcome.
